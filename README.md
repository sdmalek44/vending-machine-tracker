# Vending Machine Tracker

Weâ€™re developing an application to track vending machines across the city.

Vending machines may be stocked with different snacks, and the same snack may be available at many different places throughout the city. Before you begin: what does that mean the relationship is between vending machines and snacks? How many snacks does a vending machine have? How many vending machines can a snack (or maybe a better way to think of it is a type of snack) be in?
